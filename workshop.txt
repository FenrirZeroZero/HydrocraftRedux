description=[*] Less Recipes
description=[*] No Trash/Useless Items
description=[*] No Decoration Only Items

description=[*] Rebalanced Items to provide value more equal to the effort (Ex: Horse Carriage 500/100 both Hand container for large scale looting/moving)
description=[*] Rebalanced Smithing/Mining
description=[*] Switched custom script timed Items to simply use "spoiling" to switch items
description=[*] Removed the Indoor Farming restriction and functions (big farms could eat a lot of performance)
description=[*] Removed any anchoring. Its just annoying and can be cheesed for griefing (both to steal anchored items and to put them "in the way"

description=Hydrocraft Redux is a mod based around crafting and filling in the empty world of zomboid with (less) more stuff. 

This version was born to have a. an easier Update process for when the next alpha comes and to bring a version of hydrocraft that fits more with other mods.

I am Part of the current Dev team and i will help update the main version for Hydrocraft when the next alpha comes out.

Only use one Version of hydrocraft. I changed the mod id and mod name since most "addon" mods for hydrocraft will not work with redux or will be redundant.
